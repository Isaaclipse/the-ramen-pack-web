So you want to be a cosplay photographer? Maybe your friends are cosplayers and go to conventions, and you happen to be their handy camera person. Or, maybe you have experience with photography and you want to turn your hobby into a new found passion. Whatever the reason, here are our tips for making the first move and entering the world of cosplay photography.

    1. Seek advice from professionals

If you know someone who works in your field of interest or has similar interests and experience ask them for advice! Tell them you're just starting out and need experience. Take advice from these people. They have been there before you and can often give you their input on what best practices to take. Or tell you what best to avoid doing! Either way, this advice may sometimes be valuable!

    2. Set goals and expectations

It's a very commonly shared piece of advice. And also a highly overlooked one. But the truth is that structure adds some peace of mind and ease to your agenda. When you start to put more time and work into this you will start to see results. The progress you make will be visible. And it will feel amazing.

    3. Do your research and make a budget

If you think about how much photographers spend on cameras and equipment it is easy to say that this piece of advice is very important. Cosplay photography can be an expensive hobby for newcomers. If you already have a camera you feel comfortable with then even better. This is all you really need to get started. Lights and other equipment is a different convo, which we really recommend doing your research on. You can find some suggestions on lights here: https://cr8.lv/2qlLSbd

    4. Promote yourself

 To your friends. Family. Community! Starting off a new hobby like cosplay photography is exciting. The people you know will want to see your work. And especially what you can do.

    5. Stay confident in your abilities and be open to learning

This is key. Confidence goes a very long way. For us, it started as a hobby too. We recommend taking classes or workshops at local photography groups or businesses. Start building a network. Eventually you will find a network of like-minded people. Maybe even start a media company (it's all about the confidence).
